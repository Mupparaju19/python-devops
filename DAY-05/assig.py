#Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
#Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
#Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.
#Print the results.
a=5
b=6
print(a-b)
print(a+b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)

#Task 2: Comparison Operators
#Compare the values of a and b using the following comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=.
#Print the results of each comparison.
a=6
b=5
print(a>b)
print(a<b)
print(a<=b)
print(a>=b)
print(a==b)
print(a!=b)

#Task 3: Logical Operators
#Create two boolean variables, x and y.
#Use logical operators (and, or, not) to perform various logical operations on x and y.
#Print the results.

x=True
y=False 
print(x and y)      
print(x or y)         
print(not x)           
print(not y)           

#Task 4: Assignment Operators
#Create a variable total and initialize it to 10.
#Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to update the value of total.
#Print the final value of total.

total = 10
total+= 10 
total-= 10
total*= 10
total/= 10
print(total)
